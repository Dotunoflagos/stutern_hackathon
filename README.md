Problem Statement:\
Simplifying Small Business Payments

## About / Synopsis

### User story:
    As a small business owner,
    I want to efficiently manage payments and track invoices
    so that I can streamline the process and ensure timely transactions.

### Break down:
    As a business owner, I can create and maintain client profiles.
    I can generate unique invoice links for each transaction.
    I want to prevent duplicate payments for the same invoice.
    I should receive real-time alerts when invoices are unpaid.
    Upon invoice payment by the customer, We both receive receipts via email.

For this solution, We can utilize the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for building the application.
Here are some free and open-source technologies that we can used:

## Backend (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB)

Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js, simplifying API creation.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database to store client profiles, invoices, and payment status.
